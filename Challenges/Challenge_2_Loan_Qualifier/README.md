# Loan Qualifier App

This application connects a customer in search of a loan with a number of suitable banks. Using command-line-interface (CLI), the customer informs the app of their credit score, monthly debt-to-income ratio, loan-to-value ratio, and the size of their requested loan. The app then uses these metrics to filter through a list of banks, selecting only those which the customer qualifies for. The customer is able to save their list of applicable banks to a spreadsheet.

This application is an efficient and easy solution for the customer to quickly find a custom-tailored list of banks who can offer them a loan.
